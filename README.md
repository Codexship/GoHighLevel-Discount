# GoHighLevel Discount and Summer Promo Code (50% OFF)
HighLevel Discount is now available

Most people wait too long to start using real marketing software like [HighLevel](https://getplatform.link/ghl-discount) — and honestly, price is the biggest reason. I get it.

They dropped a summer sale that’s too good to ignore — and yes, even current users can cash in.

## GoHighLevel’s Summer Promo: 50% Off Any Plan for 3 Months

<a href="https://getplatform.link/ghl-discount"><img width="718" alt="Screenshot 2025-06-09 at 7 18 07 PM" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/38a08091-961d-4587-ad6a-6b8fabddac1c" /></a>

From June 9 through June 23, GoHighLevel is offering half off your monthly price for the first 3 months. No long-term contracts. No gimmicks.

Here’s what that actually looks like:

* Starter plan: $97 → $48.50/month

* Unlimited plan: $297 → $148.50/month

* Pro plan: $497 → $248.50/month

This isn’t just for new users either. Already paying for HighLevel? You can still grab the discount and cut your bill in half for the next 90 days.

It’s one of the few times HighLevel rewards existing users — and it beats the typical annual discount by a mile if you want to keep things flexible.

If you’ve ever considered switching to HighLevel or upgrading your current plan, now’s the move. But the window is tight. After June 23 at 11:59 PM PST, full prices are back and this offer disappears.

## So, What Exactly Is GoHighLevel?
[GoHighLevel](https://getplatform.link/ghl-discount) is the tool you grab when you're done juggling five different apps just to manage your clients or sales pipeline.

It’s a full-blown CRM, funnel builder, email + SMS automation hub, calendar booking system, and white-label SaaS platform — all rolled into one. If you're running a digital agency or coaching business, this thing was built with you in mind.

Instead of piecing together ClickFunnels + ActiveCampaign + Calendly + PipeDrive (and paying for all of them separately), GoHighLevel gives you one clean dashboard to do it all. And yep, it’s customizable as hell.

### Who uses it?
* Marketing agencies managing multiple clients
* Coaches, course creators, and service providers
* SaaS resellers who want to white-label a system and sell it as their own
* Anyone tired of tech duct tape and monthly bills stacking up

Whether you want to build automated workflows, launch landing pages, or handle client leads without chaos, HighLevel’s got you covered.

## Why Catching a GoHighLevel Discount Right Now Is a Smart Move
Look, [HighLevel is legit](https://getplatform.link/ghl-discount). It replaces multiple tools, gives you agency-level control, and can even turn into its own SaaS business. But it’s also not cheap. And when you’re trying to keep costs lean — especially in the early or scaling phase — saving a few hundred bucks isn’t just “nice to have”… it’s a real business advantage.

Here’s the deal: timing your sign-up right can literally save you $250 to $750 over three months. That’s money you can throw into ad spend, software add-ons, or your first VA. It’s not pocket change — it’s momentum.

### What makes this summer discount different from most?

* You don’t have to pay for a full year upfront.
* You’re not stuck in a contract.
* You don’t have to be a new user to qualify.
* You don’t need to hunt down obscure promo codes.

It’s a clean, easy win that gets you in the door fast and gives you three solid months to learn the platform, test what works, and start building systems that actually run without you.

That kind of time + savings combo doesn’t come around often — especially from tools that rarely discount at all.

## Let’s Compare: Which GoHighLevel Deal Makes the Most Sense?
### Summer Super Promo (Best for Immediate Savings)
If you’re looking for the biggest bang for your buck right now, the Summer Super Promo is the one to beat. It gives you [50% off your first three months](https://getplatform.link/ghl-discount), and it’s available until June 23 — no coupon code needed, and no annual commitment required. What really makes this offer stand out is that it works for both new users and existing ones, which is almost unheard of in the SaaS world. You can jump in, test the platform, and build out your setup without paying full price right out of the gate. For anyone wanting to launch fast and save upfront, this is the most aggressive discount GoHighLevel has ever run.

### Annual Plan Discount (Best for Long-Term Commitment)
If you already know you’re in it for the long haul, the annual plan offers a consistent [17% discount over monthly pricing](https://getplatform.link/ghl-discount). You pay for the full year upfront, which can be a big chunk of change, but it saves you money over time if you plan to stick with the platform. This route is better suited for agencies that are already growing, know they’ll use HighLevel long-term, and want to avoid monthly billing altogether. Just keep in mind, it’s not as flexible or as steep of a discount in the short-term as the summer promo.

### Affiliate or Partner Perks (Best for Extra Bonuses)
Some official GoHighLevel affiliates offer unique signup perks [like extended 30-day trials](https://www.gohighlevel.com/affiliate-30trial?fp_ref=khris92&fp_sid=kd30days), ready-to-use funnels, onboarding templates, or personal support. While these don’t always cut the price directly, they do add a lot of value — especially if you’re new and don’t want to start from scratch. If you’re signing up through a trusted partner, those extra resources can make getting started smoother and faster, which is worth considering if you’re not super technical or just want to hit the ground running.

## How to Claim the GoHighLevel Summer Promo (50% Off)
Step 1: Head to the Official Promo Page
Start by [visiting GoHighLevel’s official Summer Super Promo page](https://getplatform.link/ghl-discount). This is where the deal is activated automatically — no need to search for coupon codes or use any third-party sites.

### Step 2: Pick Your Plan
Choose the plan that best fits your business right now. Whether it’s the $97 Starter, $297 Unlimited, or $497 Pro option, all of them are eligible for the 50% discount. You’ll see the promo pricing applied when you go to sign up.

### Step 6: Confirm the Discount Is Applied

## GoHighLevel Promo FAQs – What You Need to Know
### Is this 50% Summer Promo official?
Yes, this is a direct offer from GoHighLevel — not a third-party or affiliate-exclusive deal. It’s live on their site and applies to both new and existing users during the promo period. No shady links or weird workarounds involved.

### Can I combine this with a free trial or another discount?
No. This deal replaces the typical 14-day free trial, but in return, you’re getting three months at half price — which is a far better deal if you’re serious about trying the platform. It also can’t be combined with the annual discount or any other ongoing promo codes.

### What if I already have a GoHighLevel account?
Good news: you’re still eligible. This is one of the few GoHighLevel offers that current users can actually use. Whether you’re upgrading your plan or restarting a paused account, you can take advantage of the 50% off pricing as long as you act before the deadline.

### When does this offer expire?
The Summer Super Promo ends on June 23 at 11:59 PM PST. After that, standard pricing resumes and this specific deal won’t be available. There are no guarantees it’ll return in the same form later, so if you’re interested, now’s the time.

### What happens after the three months?
Once the discounted period ends, your account will automatically roll into standard monthly pricing based on the plan you chose. You can switch to annual billing at that point if you want to continue saving long term.

### The discount didn’t show — what should I do?
If the promo pricing isn’t showing during checkout, make sure you’re on the correct landing page and within the promo window. Still having issues? Contact GoHighLevel support before submitting payment — they’re usually fast to respond.

## Final Thoughts: Why This Deal Is Worth Jumping On
[GoHighLevel](https://getplatform.link/ghl-discount) isn’t some trend — it’s become the go-to platform for marketers, agency owners, and creators who want to run everything from one place without cobbling together a dozen tools.

But let’s be honest: price is the one thing that makes people hesitate.

That’s why this Summer Super Promo is such a big deal. You’re getting full access to every feature, on any plan, for half the price — for three whole months. No commitment, no guessing. Just a chance to finally use the tools you’ve been watching from the sidelines.

If you’re serious about systemizing your client work, selling services more efficiently, or even white-labeling your own SaaS… this is your window.

The offer expires on June 23 at 11:59 PM PST, and once it’s gone, you’re back to full price. No rollover, no rainchecks.
